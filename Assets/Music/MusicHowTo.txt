- create a big transparent box and make it a trigger.
- tag it as CombatZone
- make an empty game object ("MusicPlayer") that is a child of the main camera
- Add multiple audio sources to it.
- check loop and play on awake.
- import audio clips
- Create "Audio Mixer" in audio folder
- Create groups for each track in the audio tab
- Output each song to their respective group

- create a script called "NameOfMusicControl"


public AudioMixerSnapshot outOfCombat;
public AudioMixerSnapshot inCombat;

#transition sound
public AudioClip[] stings;
public AudioSource

public float bpm = 140;

private float m_TransitionIn;
private float m_TransitionOut;
private float m_QuarterNote;

void Start ()
{

	m_QuarterNote = 60 / bpm;
	m_TransitionIn = m_QuarterNote;
	m_TransitionOut = m_QuarterNote * 32;	
}

void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
{
	if (other.CompareTag("CombatZone"))
	{
		inCombat.TransitionTo(m_TransitionIn);
	}
}

void OnTriggerExit(Collider other)
{
	if (other.CompareTag("CombatZone"))
	{
		outOfCombat.TransitionTo(m_TransitionOut);
	}
}


- Attach this script to the player or a collider attached to the player...
- Drag in those groups from earlier into the public variables of the script
